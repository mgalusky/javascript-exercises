==== EXERCISE 12: LARGEST ARRAY ====

Given an array of arrays (two-dimensional array) where each child of an inner array is a number, find the array with the largest sum of numbers.

Example:

  var numbers = [
    [23,42,29,19,10], //123
    [3,63,1,45,23,12,1], //148
    [10,21,19,40,1,2,6,8], //107
    [0,2,77,10] //89
  ];

  Largest array: [3,63,1,45,23,12,1] //148
