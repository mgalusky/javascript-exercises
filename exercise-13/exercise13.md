==== EXERCISE 13: GUESS A NUMBER ====

1. Declare a variable `randomNumber` and set its value to a random number between 1-10
  Hint: To generate a random decimal between 0 and 1, use Math.random(). You'll have to figure out how to turn this decimal into a whole number.

2. Create a while() loop that asks the user via a prompt() for a random guess between 1 and 10. The while() loop's condition should only break the loop when the user guesses the right number.

3. Congratulate the user with an alert() when they've guessed the right number.
