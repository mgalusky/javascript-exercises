==== EXERCISE 7: CHESS BOARD ====

1. Write two nested for() loops that create a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using newline characters (\n) to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a “#” character. The characters should form a chess board.

2. Pass this string to console.log() until it matches the following:

 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #

2. When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a variable size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.
