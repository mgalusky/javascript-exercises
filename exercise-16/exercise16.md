==== EXERCISE 16: CHARACTER COUNTING ====

1. Write a function `countCharacters` that accepts two arguments `str` and `character`.

2. Have your function return the total times a character is mentioned in the `str` string.

3. Write a test case to make sure your function is working!

Example usage of your function:

  countCharacters('My awesome string', 'e') outputs 2

Think: As it stands, your function is likely case sensitive. How might you add another argument to control that behavior?
