==== EXERCISE 10: ADVANCED GRADING SYSTEM ====

1. Create a for() loop to iterate over each student object found in the `students` array.

2. For each student, print out their name and grade based on the rubric from exercise 9.
  - Use string concatenation to put the name and grade together in a single console.log() with a
  colon. Example: John Doe: A

3. Check to make sure you're printing out the right grades based on the rubric.
