==== EXERCISE 11: EXPENSIVE GROCERIES ====

1. You don't know the structure of the `groceries` array, how might you find this out before continuing?

2. Create a for() loop to iterate over each item in the `groceries` array.

3. If an item on your list is more expensive than $10.00, print its name and price using console.log(), assign it a new property `cheap` and set it to false.

4. If an item on your list is less expensive than $10.00, add a new property `cheap` and set it to true.

5. Output your modified `groceries` array and check it out.

6. How would you determine the most expensive item in the list?
