==== EXERCISE 9: GRADING SYSTEM ====

1. Create a for() loop to iterate over the `grades` array and print the number and grade based on this rubric:

  >95   : A
  88-95 : B
  80-88 : C
  72-80 : D
  65-72 : E
  <65   : F

  Single line from an example output: "94 = B"

2. Check to make sure you're printing out the right grades based on the rubric.
