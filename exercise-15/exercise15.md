==== EXERCISE 15: REBUILD MATH.MIN() ====

1. Learn about what Math.min() does [http://mdn.io/min] and test it out.

2. Build your own function `min` to replicate the behavior of Math.min() EXCEPT that your function requires one argument that is an array as opposed to an unlimited number of arguments like the real Math.min().

Example usage of your function:

  min([2,3,54,3,17]) outputs 2
